# ipsum-blog

This was a fun project to further understand jQuery Mobile, how it worked and what its capabilities were. Because the project was more about getting to grips with the library, I wasnâ€™t particularly concerned with the content. 

Initially, I downloaded the jQuery Mobile files locally and experimented with the themes and styling. The default themes are clean and easy to use. In this site, the blog loads different content on the page without refreshing the page itself. Instead of navigating to different files, content is loaded on one page and dynamically revealed and hidden using a combination of internal links and jQuery. This provides a neat, clean user experience. It does mean the code can becoming unwieldy given that you have a lot of HTML in a single file.

As I was less concerned with the content, I originally filled out some of the sample pages with Lorem Ipsum. However, I often use various Lorem Ipsum generators to make the generic text a little more interesting or more suited to the project I am working on. For example, when working on corporate projects, I tend to use Office Ipsum - featured in the blog - as it is more relevant to the project and mildly amusing. Therefore, to give this site a little more purpose, I decided to showcase the sample text created by some of my favourite Ipsum generators.
