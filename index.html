		<p>Oh, you're a dollar naughtier than most. They're like sex, except I'm having them! It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. Oh God, what have I done? And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Large bet on myself in round one. Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Shut up and get to the point! We're rescuing ya.</p>

I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>

		<p>I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly… Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone.</p>

She's a witch! The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Look, my liege! Burn her! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Burn her anyway!</p>

Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Please do not offer my god a peanut. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies.</p>

		<p>I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. He didn't give you gay, did he? Did he?! Me fail English? That's unpossible. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! I don't like being outdoors, Smithers.
